Chandrayaan-3 is the third and most recent lunar Indian Space Research exploration mission under the Chandrayaan programme.
It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter.
Its propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite.
